About
-----

I Studied computer science in Helsinki University. Started off my engineering career doing embeddeinux firmware development. Spent my early career in startup environment writing JavaScript. Continued my career doing open source software engineering for the city of Helsinki. Spent some time freelancing. Currently I work in technology consulting and specialize in web technologies.

I'm a Bachelor of Science from Computer Science. During my studies I developed an interest towards interaction technologies. As a personal project I have been working with a gesture interaction project built using node.js. I organized a collaborative effort to further develop the project. I'm always interested in mentoring people on topics revolving around programming.

I got into IoT after working on a home automation project. After that I moved my focus to Virtual Reality. Joined the Finnish Virtual Reality Association, participated in a handful of startups, got a couple of freelance gigs doing VR/AR solutions.
